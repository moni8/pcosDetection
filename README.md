## Project Title
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Detection using Machine Learning


## Description of the project
PCOS is a serious concern nowadays with women of childbearing age all over the world. It causes various health issues like Infertility, Type 2 diabetes, Endometrial Cancer, Cardiovascular disease, and Depression. Another major concern with the syndrome is there is no similarity in the experience of every other woman.

Diagnosis of the syndrome with Machine Learning (ML) classification techniques such as Logistic Regression and Random Forrest Classifier will give a rough idea about its existence in a woman. 

This project aims to provide a close to medical accuracy PCOS detection at a much more affordable cost compared to the use of advanced medical equipment (blood tests, ultrasound) which would be reducing the burden of medical expenses on families who are not financially secure. The project once finished can also serve as a reference for further improvements and updates to have better functionality and faster, more accurate results.

## Description of data sets
The tentative dataset we will use for this project contains data from 541 patients across 10 hospitals in Kerala, India. The data contains over 44 physical and clinical parameters for each patient, which will be used as our input.

## Machine learning models:

Following machine learning models are used to analyze the dataset and predict the PCOS in a patient:

### 1. Logistic Regression

### 2. Random Forest

### 3. Support Vector Machine
